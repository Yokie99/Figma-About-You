// Using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS, I created a website about a fictional Blastoise from Pokemon. There are 3 pages included and a navbar that directs you around the different pages.


//Peer Review: Jared Ly
//Review: The code and visuals are great, I liked how inside the code there are comments that differentiate the different bootstrap elements which helps with reading.
